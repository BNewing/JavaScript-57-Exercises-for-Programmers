# JavaScript-57-Exercises-for-Programmers

In this project, I will work through each of the 57 exercises in Brian P. Hogan's book, 'Exercises for Programmers: 57 Challenges to Develop your Coding Skills'. I will do these in JavaScript.

I'll create a GitHub pages index page, and then link to the various challenges on separate pages. I'll add in the challenge pages as I do them.

This will be an exercise in consolidating and growing my JavaScript knowledge!
