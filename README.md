# JavaScript-57-Exercises-for-Programmers

In this learning project, I'm working through each of the 57 exercises in Brian P. Hogan's book, 'Exercises for Programmers: 57 Challenges to Develop your Coding Skills', in JavaScript.

I've created a site and I'm adding each challenge onto a list on the home page as I go!
